Which of these two groups do you feel most strongly attached to?* \\[see, for example, @afrobarometer2020\\]. The framing of this question assumes that ethnic identification is incompatible with national identification. But is that necessarily true? Could it not be that some people are dual identifiers -- identifying with both their ethnicity and their nationality?\n\nI hypothesize that ethnic and national identification are compatible. Hence, when measuring the two independently, there should be no negative relationship between them.\n\n*Hypothesis: There is no significant negative correlation between ethnic and national identification.*\n\nThe above survey question reflects a unidimensional conception of identity. An increase in ethnic identification is directly associated with the same decrease in national identity (Figure 1). A bidimensional conception of identity, in contrast, reflects that ethnic and national identification can be independent of each other (Figure 2).\n\n![](images/Screenshot 2024-04-07 133304.png)\n\nIf ethnic and national identification are incompatible, all observations will cluster on the dashed diagonal in Figure 2. However, if the hypothesis is correct, we will see significant spread around the diagonal and might also find observations in the first and third quadrants.\n\nThe following studies provide support for my hypothesis:\n\n-   @davis1999 reports two different forms of Basque identification. One entails attachment to a Basque nation, the other is 'apolitical' in that it dissociates the nationalist movement from its perception of being Basque. It seems like dual identification might be possible among individuals who hold an apolitical form of ethnic identification.\n\n-   @ryder2000 find that ethnic identification and national identification are independent and have distinctive correlations with external variables among immigrants in the US.\n\n-   A study of adolescent immigrants from 13 countries confirms Ryder's findings. The relationship between ethnic and national identification varies widely both across countries and across individuals -- reaching from negative to no relationship to positive [@berry2006]. Graphically, this means that there are observations in all four quadrants. Â \n\nAdditionally, I will explore if there are any characteristics particular to those individuals who identify both with their ethnicity and nationality. Do they tend to have more social connections, for example? Do they predominantly live in urban areas? This might spark some ideas about how to foster dual-identification in fractured societies.\n\n### Research Design\n\nI use the follwing linear regression model to estimate the relationship between ethnic identification and national identification.\n\n$$ Y_i =\\beta X_i + \\epsilon_i $$\n\nX is the averaged z-score of two measures of ethnic identification (see the Appendix for question wording), Y the averaged z-score of two measures of national identification, and $\\epsilon$ the error term.\n\n### Data\n\nI am using a representative survey of 825 students of Addis Ababa University. The survey consists of two waves, conducted in May-June and October-November of 2022. The data was collected by DevLab researchers from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n### Descriptives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Results\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n### Appendix\n\n**Ethnic Identity Index**\n\nQ15_2 Now I am going to read out a list of groups that people join or attend. For each one, could you tell me whether you are a CURRENT official leader, an active member, an inactive member, or not a member. - A group of people that share the same ethnicity or culture and meet regularly to discuss or advance the interests of the group.\n\nQ23 Which of the following statements is closest to your view?\n\n-   Statement A: In Ethiopia, federal states should continue to be defined based on ethnic homelands.\n\n-   Statement B: In Ethiopia, federal states should change so that they are defined based on geographical features, not ethnic homelands.\n\n**National Identity Index**\n\nQ13_5 Here is a list of actions that people sometimes take as citizens. For each of these, please tell me whether you have taken any of these actions during the past twelve months. - Contacted a government official to ask for help or make a complaint\n\nQ22 Ethiopians are very diverse. They come from different religions, ethnic groups, political parties, and economic and social backgrounds. Which of the following statements is closest to your view?\n\n-   Statement A: Overall, there is more that unites all Ethiopian as one people, than there is that divides them.\n\n-   Statement B: Overall, there is more that divides Ethiopian into different social and political groups, than there is that unites them as a single group.\n\n**Predictors of Dual Identification**\n\nQ5 Thinking about where you grew up, would you say your upbringing was mostly Urban or Rural?\n\nQ9 Thinking about your family heritage, what is the ethnic community, cultural group, or tribe that your family belongs to? If your family comes from multiple groups, you may select more than one.\n\nQ20 Which of the following statements is closest to your view?\n\n-   Statement A: Communities are stronger when they are made up of people from different ethnic groups, races, or religions.\n\n-   Statement B: Communities are stronger when they are made up of people who are similar to each other, that is, people from the same ethnic group, race, or religion.\n\nQ31 We are now interested in learning about social life at AAU. Thinking about the average week, how many friends or family members do you talk with on the phone, online, or in person?\n\nThe following are part of the endline survey ONLY\n\nQ74_1 Please tell me how often the following happens: - My ethnic group is discriminated against by members of other groups.\n",
