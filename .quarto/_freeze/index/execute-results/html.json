Which of these two groups do you feel most strongly attached to?* \\[see, for example, @afrobarometer2020\\]. This question reflects an assumption which seems to be common ... - that national and ethnic identification are incompatible. However, based on the analysis of survey data from Ethiopian students, I argue that this assumption is false and that some people identify with both their national and their ethnic identities.\n\n### Overview of the Literature\n\nStudies that have been conducted in migrant communities consistently find that ethnic identification and national identification are compatible.\n\n-   @ryder2000 find that ethnic identification and national identification are independent and have distinctive correlations with external variables among immigrants in the US.\n\n-   A study of adolescent immigrants from 13 countries confirms Ryder's findings. The relationship between ethnic and national identification varies widely both across countries and across individuals -- reaching from negative to no relationship to positive [@berry2006].\n\nThere seems to be little evidence on the social identities of non-migrant communities in multi-ethnic countries. ... Interesting ...\n\n-   @davis1999 reports two different forms of Basque identification. One entails attachment to a Basque nation, the other is 'apolitical' in that it dissociates the nationalist movement from its perception of being Basque. It seems like dual identification might be possible among individuals who hold an apolitical form of ethnic identification.\n\n### Research Design\n\nI hypothesize that ethnic and national identification are compatible. Hence, when measuring the two independently, there should be no negative relationship between them.\n\n*Hypothesis: There is no significant negative correlation between ethnic and national identification.*\n\nThe above survey question reflects a unidimensional conception of identity. An increase in ethnic identification is directly associated with the same decrease in national identity (Figure 1). A bidimensional conception of identity, in contrast, reflects that ethnic and national identification can be independent of each other (Figure 2).\n\n![](images/Screenshot%202024-04-07%20133304.png)\n\nIf ethnic and national identification are incompatible, all observations will cluster on the dashed diagonal in Figure 2. However, if the hypothesis is correct, we will see significant spread around the diagonal and might also find observations in the first and third quadrants\n\nI use the follwing linear regression model to estimate the relationship between ethnic identification and national identification.\n\n$$ Y_i =\\beta X_i + \\epsilon_i $$\n\nX is the averaged z-score of two measures of ethnic identification (see the Appendix for question wording), Y the averaged z-score of two measures of national identification, and $\\epsilon$ the error term.\n\nAdditionally, I will explore if there are any characteristics particular to those individuals who identify both with their ethnicity and nationality. Do they tend to have more social connections, for example? Do they predominantly live in urban areas? This might spark some ideas about how to foster dual-identification in fractured societies.\n\n### Data\n\nI am using a representative survey of 825 students of Addis Ababa University. The survey consists of two waves, conducted in May-June and October-November of 2022. The data was collected by DevLab researchers from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n### Descriptives\n\n\n\n\n\n**Averaged Z-Scores**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Binary Indicators**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Results\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n=============================================================\n                               Dependent variable:           \n                    -----------------------------------------\n                                 national_index              \n                            (1)                  (2)         \n-------------------------------------------------------------\nethnic_index               0.049                0.023        \n                          (0.041)              (0.043)       \n                                                             \nurban                                         -0.209***      \n                                               (0.074)       \n                                                             \ncontacts                                        0.018        \n                                               (0.066)       \n                                                             \nConstant                   0.026              0.178***       \n                          (0.032)              (0.062)       \n                                                             \n-------------------------------------------------------------\nObservations                499                  485         \nR2                         0.003                0.019        \nAdjusted R2                0.001                0.013        \nResidual Std.
