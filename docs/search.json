    "text": "Introduction\nMany surveys use the following question to probe for respondents’ ethnic and national identities: Let us suppose that you had to choose between being a (Kenyan/Ghanaian/etc). and being a (respondent’s ethnic group). Which of these two groups do you feel most strongly attached to? (see, for example, AfroBarometer 2020). This question reflects the assumption that national and ethnic identification are incompatible. However, based on the analysis of survey data from Ethiopian university students, I argue that this assumption is false and that some people identify with both their national and their ethnic identities. Furthermore, I find that neither social connectedness nor perceived discrimination change the likelihood of dual identification.\n\n\nLiterature Review\nStudies that have been conducted in migrant communities consistently find that ethnic identification and national identification are compatible. Ryder, Alden, and Paulhus (2000) find that ethnic identification and national identification are independent and have distinctive correlations with external variables among immigrants in the US. A study of adolescent immigrants from 13 countries confirms their findings. The relationship between ethnic and national identification varies widely both across countries and across individuals – reaching from negative to no relationship to positive (Berry et al. 2006).\nThere seems to be little evidence on the social identities of non-migrant communities in multi-ethnic countries. However, Davis (1999) reports two different forms of identification among Basque people. One entails attachment to a Basque nation, the other is ‘apolitical’ in that it dissociates the nationalist movement from its perception of being Basque. It seems like dual identification may be possible among individuals who hold an apolitical form of ethnic identification.\n\n\nData\nI am using a representative survey of 825 students of Addis Ababa University. The survey consists of two waves, conducted in May-June and October-November of 2022. The data was collected by DevLab researchers from the University of Pennsylvania (DevLab@Penn, n.d.).\n\n\nResearch Design\nI hypothesize that ethnic and national identification are compatible. Hence, when measuring the two independently, there should be no negative relationship between them.\nHypothesis: There is no significant negative correlation between ethnic and national identification.\nThe above survey question reflects a unidimensional conception of identity. An increase in ethnic identification is directly associated with the same decrease in national identity (Figure 1). A bidimensional conception of identity, in contrast, reflects that ethnic and national identification can be independent of each other (Figure 2).\n\nIf ethnic and national identification are incompatible, all observations will cluster on the dashed diagonal in Figure 2. However, if the hypothesis is correct, we will see significant spread around the diagonal and might also find observations in the first and third quadrants.\nTo estimate the relationship between ethnic identification and national identification, I use the following regression model.\n\\[ NationalID_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1 * EthnicID_i + \\beta_2 * SocialTies_i +  \\epsilon_i \\]\n\\(NationalID\\) is the averaged z-score of two measures of national identification (see the Appendix for question wording), \\(EthnicID\\) the averaged z-score of two measures of ethnic identification, and \\(\\epsilon\\) the error term. I also introduce two covariates. \\(SocialTies\\) is the Z-score of the number of social ties a student has. I control for the number of social ties as students who interact more with others might feel more connected to both their ethnic group and their nationality.\nAdditionally, I use a second regression model with interaction term to examine whether the relationship between ethnic identification and national identification changes across different levels of perceived discrimination.\n\\[ NationalID_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1 * EthnicID_i + \\beta_2 * Discrimination_i + \\beta_3 * (EthnicID_i * Discrimination_i) + \\epsilon_i \\]\n\\(Discrimination\\) measures perceived discrimination and can take the values ‘never’, ‘frequently’, and ‘always’. Again, I use z-scores in the regression. The assumption underlying this model is that perceived discrimination might make it harder to identify with both ethnicity and nationality. If a student feels like their ethnic group is discriminated against by other ethnic groups, they might also feel like the two forms of identification are incompatible and they are forced to choose between one and the other. Similar patterns have been found among Latino college students in the US (Fuller-Rowell, Ong, and Phinney 2013). If this assumptions is correct, we would expect a more negative relationship between ethnic identification and national identification at higher levels of perceived discrimination.\n\n\nDescriptives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\nThe graph below depicts ethnic and national identification among the students.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are observations in all four quadrants, and there seems to be no significant relationship between the two variables. The regression outputs confirm these findings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBivariate\n Interaction\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.028 (0.033)\n0.014 (0.047)\n\n\nethnicID\n0.048 (0.043)\n0.049 (0.059)\n\n\nsocial_ties\n0.024 (0.067)\n\n\n\ndiscrimination\n\n−0.088+ (0.050)\n\n\nethnicID × discrimination\n\n0.021 (0.058)\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n485\n258\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n−0.001\n0.003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no significant negative correlation between national and ethnic identification. In contrast, the coefficient for \\(EthnicID\\) is positive, even though not significant. Furthermore, the coefficient for \\(SocialTies\\) is positive, but not significant. This means that students with more social ties are not more likely to be dual identifiers. Lastly, the coefficient for the interaction term \\(EthnicID * Discrimination\\) is not statistically significant either. This means that the relationship between ethnic identification and national identification does not change across levels of perceived discrimination.\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall, it has become clear that ethnic identification and national identification can be compatible. Hence, the framing of survey questions such as that mentioned in the introduction fail to adequately measure ethnic identification and national identification. They cannot account for people who identify with both their ethnicity and their nationality. Even though the unidimensional model may be accurate in some contexts, we still need the bidimensional model to demonstrate its accuracy by showing that there is an inverse correlation. My findings also suggest that it is possible to achieve national identification even in ethnically diverse societies. National identification, in turn, can have a positive impact on state capacity and public good provision (due to willingness to pay taxes and higher levels of trust).\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAfroBarometer. 2020. “Merged Round 7 Codebook (34 Countries).” https://www.afrobarometer.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/r7_merged.codebook_final_14dec20-1-1.pdf.\n\n\nBerry, John W, Jean S Phinney, David L Sam, and Paul Vedder. 2006.

For each of these, please tell me whether you have taken any of these actions during the past twelve months. - Contacted a government official to ask for help or make a complaint (Question 13_5).\nEthiopians are very diverse. They come from different religions, ethnic groups, political parties, and economic and social backgrounds. Which of the following statements is closest to your view (Question 22)?\n\nStatement A: Overall, there is more that unites all Ethiopian as one people, than there is that divides them.\nStatement B: Overall, there is more that divides Ethiopian into different social and political groups, than there is that unites them as a single group.\n\nSocial Ties (Co-variate)\nWe are now interested in learning about social life at AAU. Thinking about the average week, how many friends or family members do you talk with on the phone, online, or in person (Question 31)?\nPerceived Discrimination (Interaction)\nPlease tell me how often the following happens: - My ethnic group is discriminated against by members of other groups (Question 74_1)."
