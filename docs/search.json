    "text": "1 Introduction\nMany surveys use the following question to probe for respondents’ ethnic and national identities: Let us suppose that you had to choose between being a (Kenyan/Ghanaian/etc) and being a (respondent’s ethnic group). Which of these two groups do you feel most strongly attached to? (see, for example, AfroBarometer 2020). This question reflects the assumption that national and ethnic identification are incompatible. However, based on the analysis of survey data from Ethiopian university students, I argue that this assumption is false. Across different levels of perceived discrimination, there is no negative correlation between the two forms of identification. Moreover, I find that multiculturalism does not currently function as a mechanism to foster dual identification among the students.\n\n\n2 Literature Review\nMuch of post-colonial literature reflects an assimilationist model of national identity. In the first decades after decolonization, leaders of many African states focused on promoting a unified national identity to strengthen newly-formed nation-states. This commonly involved assimilating various ethnic groups, as ethnic diversity was perceived as a source of conflict. For instance, in Botswana, assimilationist policies aimed to construct a national identity based on Tswana culture. Similarly, in Tanzania, the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) under Julius Nyerere attempted to build a national identity around Swahili culture and language. Consequently, members of minority groups often faced a tradeoff, having to sacrifice aspects of their ethnic identity to gain benefits associated with national identification, such as better career opportunities (Mulimbi and Dryden-Peterson 2019; Campbell 1999).\nOnly recently has there been a theoretical shift from the assimilationist model to a multicultural one, recognizing the potential for national identification to coexist alongside ethnic identification. Within the multicultural framework, cultural diversity is seen as integral to national identity, and ethnic diversity is acknowledged as facilitating the coexistence and cooperation of different groups (Priwati et al. 2021).\nMuch of the research on the multicultural model has been conducted in migrant communities, consistently finding that ethnic and national identification are compatible. For instance, Ryder, Alden, and Paulhus (2000) report that ethnic and national identification are independent and have distinctive correlations with external variables during the acculturation process among immigrants in the US. In particular, some immigrants appear to incorporate their heritage and mainstream cultural identities. A more recent study surveying adolescent immigrants from 13 countries confirms these findings, showing a varied relationship between ethnic and national identification across countries and individuals, ranging from negative to positive (Berry et al. 2006).\nCurrently, there seems to be limited evidence on the social identities of non-migrant communities in multi-ethnic countries. However, Davis (1999) reports two distinct forms of identification among the Basque people. One entails attachment to the Basque nation, while the other is ‘apolitical’ in that it dissociates the nationalist movement from the perception of being Basque. This suggests the possibility of dual identification among individuals holding an apolitical form of ethnic identity. Further, evidence from secondary schools in Botswana suggests that both majority and minority ethnic students perceive their ethnic and national identities as compatible (Mulimbi and Dryden-Peterson 2019).\n\n\n3 Data\nTo evaluate the assumption that ethnic and national identification are incompatible, I use data from a representative survey of 825 students at Addis Ababa University (AAU). The survey comprises two waves, conducted in May-June and October-November of 2022. The data was collected by DevLab researchers from the University of Pennsylvania (Mengsteab et al. 2023).\nTo capture the strength of respondents’ ethnic identification, I use the averaged z-score of measures resulting from two survey questions. The first question asks if the respondent participates in any group that advocates for the interests of their ethnicity or culture. The second asks if the respondent believes that the federal states in Ethiopia should be defined based on ethnic homelands or based on geographic features (see the appendix for exact question wordings).\nBoth survey questions imperfectly approximate, rather than perfectly measure, ethnic identification. Relatively strong ethnic identification seems to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for activism in the groups’ interest. While activism likely implies strong ethnic identification, some of those who strongly identify with their ethnicity may not be members of activist groups. The same logic applies to the latter question. Relatively strong ethnic identification, too, seems to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for the belief that federal states should be defined based on ethnic homelands. Someone who identifies with their ethnicity may still advocate for federal states based on geographical features. Therefore, it seems likely that the measure overall underestimates the strength of ethnic identification.\nTo capture the strength of respondents’ national identification, I again use the averaged z-score of measures resulting from two different survey questions. One question asks if respondents think there is more that unites all Ethiopians as a people or if there is more that divides them. The other one asks if the respondent has contacted a government official within the past twelve months to ask for help or to make a complaint.\nThe latter question, in particular, is an imperfect measure of national identification. Engagement with the government is an imprecise measure of ethnic identification. On the one hand, engagement with the official state apparatus does not necessarily imply identification with the Ethiopian nationality - especially if the respondent engaged with the government only to make a complaint. On the other hand, a respondent who identifies strongly with their nationality need not necessarily engage with their government. Further, respondents might also report interactions with local instead of national government officials, who might not be associated with the Ethiopian state. However, intuitively, engaging with the government indicates some form of national identification.\n\n\n4 Hypothesis\nI hypothesize that ethnic and national identification are compatible. Hence, when measuring the two independently, there should be no negative relationship between them.\nHypothesis: There is no significant negative correlation between ethnic and national identification.\nThe survey question mentioned in the introduction reflects a unidimensional conception of identity. An increase in ethnic identification is directly associated with the same decrease in national identity (Figure 1). The bidimensional conception of identity embraced by my hypothesis, in contrast, reflects that ethnic and national identification can be independent of each other (Figure 2).\n\nIf ethnic and national identification are incompatible, all observations will cluster on the dashed diagonal in Figure 2. However, if the hypothesis is correct, we will see significant spread around the diagonal and also find observations in the first and third quadrants.\n\n\n5 Research Design\nTo estimate the relationship between ethnic identification and national identification, I will use the following regression model.\n\\[ NationalID_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1 * EthnicID_i +  \\epsilon_i \\]\nIn a second model, I will introduce an interaction term to examine whether the relationship between ethnic identification and national identification changes across different levels of perceived discrimination. I use z-scores for the regression.\n\\[ NationalID_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1 * EthnicID_i + \\beta_2 * Discrimination_i + \\beta_3 * (EthnicID_i * Discrimination_i) + \\epsilon_i \\]\nThe assumption underlying this model is that discrimination could make it harder for students to identify with both their ethnicity and nationality at the same time. If a student feels like their ethnic group is discriminated against by other ethnic groups, they may perceive the two forms of identification to be mutually exclusive. In that case, they would have to choose between one and the other, and we would see a negative relationship between ethnic identification and national identification at high levels of perceived discrimination. Such patterns have been found, for example, among Latino college students in the US (Fuller-Rowell, Ong, and Phinney 2013).\nFinally, I will test if students at AAU develop dual identification through the mechanism of multiculturalism.\n\\[ NationalID_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1 * EthnicID_i + \\beta_2 * Multiculturalism_i +  \\epsilon_i \\]\n\\(Multiculturalism\\) reflects the degree to which students believe that diverse communities are stronger than homogeneous communities are (see appendix for question wording). Again, I use z-scores for the regression. Priwati et al. (2021) find that in Indonesia, multiculturalism partially mediates the relationship between ethnic and national identification. This indicates that multiculturalism can be a mechanism fostering dual identification in societies where diversity is an important aspect of national identity. Indonesia’s national motto, for example, is ‘unity in diversity’. The dashed lines in Figure 3 below illustrate that relationship. If multiculturalism is a mediator in Ethiopia, too, multiculturalism would be positively correlated with national identification when holding ethnic identification constant. Moreover, the relationship between the two forms of identification, represented by the solid line in Figure 3, would be less positive when controlling for multiculturalism than it is in the simple linear regression model.\n\n\n\n6 Research Context\nThe relationship between ethnic identification and national identification may vary substantially across countries. Still, Ethiopia appears to be a suitable context to test my hypothesis. Although the Ethiopian people share some strong cultural traits, all major groups follow their own customs and traditions (Marcus, Crummey, and Mehretu 2024). Moreover, Ethiopia was in the midst of the civil war when the survey was conducted. The conflict between the Tigray region and the federal government had turned violent in November of 2020 - one and a half years before the first round of the survey. Hence, Ethiopia appears to be a very likely context to find a negative relationship between ethnic and national identification, if such a relationship exists anywhere. If there is no negative relationship between the two in Ethiopia, we can be quite confident that there is no negative relationship in other countries either.\n\n\n7 Results\n\n7.1 Sample Characteristics\nThe graphs below visualize the distributions of the four variables I use for my analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distributions of ethnic and national identification are both negatively skewed. This implies that there are few students with relatively strong national identification and few with relatively strong ethnic identification. For national identification, the observations are concentrated on specific numbers because 83% of all respondents (excluding those with no response) say that they have not contacted any government official within the past twelve months. Hence, respondents’ beliefs about the unity of the Ethiopian people are the key driver of the distribution. For instance, the peak at .3 represents respondents who have not interacted with the government but strongly believe in the unity of the Ethiopian people.\nThe bottom-left graph shows that nearly half of the students report frequent discrimination against their ethnic group, with approximately one third stating their group experiences no discrimination at all. Eighteen percent say their group faces constant discrimination.\nThe bottom-right graph shows that the belief in multiculturalism is overall weak among the surveyed students. 43% of them strongly believe that homogeneous communities are stronger than diverse ones, and only 4% strongly believe that the opposite is true.\n\n\n7.2 Regression Analysis\nThe graph below depicts ethnic and national identification among the students as well as the line of best fit resulting from bivariate regression without any controls.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see observations in all four quadrants, and the regression line has a slightly positive slope, implying that there is no negative correlation between the two forms of identification. This is in line with my hypothesis, and the regression outputs confirm those findings as well as their robustness against potential confounders. The following table provides the summaries of the three models outlined above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBivariate\n Interaction\nBivariate w/ Control\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.026 (0.032)\n0.014 (0.047)\n0.026 (0.031)\n\n\nethnicID\n0.049 (0.041)\n0.049 (0.059)\n0.053 (0.041)\n\n\ndiscrimination\n\n−0.088+ (0.050)\n\n\n\nethnicID × discrimination\n\n0.021 (0.058)\n\n\n\nmulticulturalism\n\n\n−0.104*** (0.030)\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n499\n258\n498\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.001\n0.003\n0.023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn none of the three models is there a significant negative correlation between national and ethnic identification. In contrast, the coefficients for \\(EthnicID\\) are all positive, even though not significant (0.049, 0.049, and 0.053).\nIn the second model, the coefficient for the interaction term \\(EthnicID * Discrimination\\) is small and not statistically significant (0.021). This means that the relationship between ethnic identification and national identification does not significantly change across different levels of perceived discrimination. Regardless of whether students think their group is never, frequently, or always discriminated against, the relationship between ethnic and national identification is not negative.\nLastly, the coefficient for \\(EthnicID\\) is more positive when controlling for multiculturalism in the last model than it is in the simple linear regression model (0.53 compared to 0.49). However, the difference between the two is not statistically significant. Hence, multiculturalism does not function as a mechanism to foster dual identification among students at AAU. Moreover, the coefficient for \\(Multiculturalism\\) is negative and statistically significant (-0.104). This means that holding ethnic identification constant, an increase by one standard deviation in multiculturalism on average leads to a decrease of .1 standard deviations in national identification.\n\n\n\n8 Discussion and Implications\nOverall, my findings indicate that there is no tradeoff between ethnic and national identification - even when students think that their ethnic group is discriminated against. Positive implications of this are that dual identification is possible and that there is the potential to achieve national identification even in diverse societies in which people strongly identify with their ethnicity. National identification, in turn, can improve state capacity and public good provision.\nYet, one key limitation of my analysis is that the sample, taken from college students at AAU, is not representative of the Ethiopian population as a whole. While Ethiopia is an unlikely case to find evidence in favor of my hypothesis, the student body of AAU is a likely test case within the nation. College students’ social identities likely differ from those of the wider population. For instance, college students are likely better educated about and more involved in national politics, making them more likely to identify as Ethiopian. Hence, further research is necessary to test the external validity of my findings.\nAt the moment, multiculturalism prevents rather than fosters national identification among the students. The war between the federal government and the Tigray reinforces a culture of animosity between ethnicities rather than embracing one that promotes diversity. In the future, establishing multiculturalism as part of the national identity may be an effective strategy to foster dual identification.\nIn terms of methodology, my findings suggest that unidimensional models fail to adequately measure social identities. In particular, such models cannot account for people who identify with both their ethnicity and their nationality. Even if unidimensional models may be accurate in some contexts, we still need the bidimensional model to demonstrate the accuracy of unidimensional ones by showing that there is indeed a negative correlation between two forms of identification (Ryder, Alden, and Paulhus (2000)). Thus, if my hypothesis is valid for broader populations, we will need to reconsider the wording of survey questions designed to capture social identities and give respondents the opportunity to separately rank the strength of their ethnic and national identification.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAfroBarometer. 2020. “Merged Round 7 Codebook (34 Countries).” https://www.afrobarometer.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/r7_merged.codebook_final_14dec20-1-1.pdf.\n\n\nBerry, John W, Jean S Phinney, David L Sam, and Paul Vedder. 2006.
