### Introduction

Many surveys use the following question to probe for respondents' ethnic and national identities: *Let us suppose that you had to choose between being a (Kenyan/Ghanaian/etc). and being a (respondent's ethnic group). Which of these two groups do you feel most strongly attached to?* [see, for example, @afrobarometer2020]. This question reflects the assumption that national and ethnic identification are incompatible. However, based on the analysis of survey data from Ethiopian university students, I argue that this assumption is false and that some people identify with both their national and their ethnic identities. Furthermore, I find that neither social connectedness nor perceived discrimination change the likelihood of dual identification.

### Literature Review

Studies that have been conducted in migrant communities consistently find that ethnic identification and national identification are compatible. @ryder2000 find that ethnic identification and national identification are independent and have distinctive correlations with external variables among immigrants in the US. A study of adolescent immigrants from 13 countries confirms their findings. The relationship between ethnic and national identification varies widely both across countries and across individuals -- reaching from negative to no relationship to positive [@berry2006].

There seems to be little evidence on the social identities of non-migrant communities in multi-ethnic countries. However, @davis1999 reports two different forms of identification among Basque people. One entails attachment to a Basque nation, the other is 'apolitical' in that it dissociates the nationalist movement from its perception of being Basque. It seems like dual identification may be possible among individuals who hold an apolitical form of ethnic identification.

### Data

I am using a representative survey of 825 students of Addis Ababa University. The survey consists of two waves, conducted in May-June and October-November of 2022. The data was collected by DevLab researchers from the University of Pennsylvania [@DevLabAAU].

### Research Design

I hypothesize that ethnic and national identification are compatible. Hence, when measuring the two independently, there should be no negative relationship between them.

*Hypothesis: There is no significant negative correlation between ethnic and national identification.*

The above survey question reflects a unidimensional conception of identity. An increase in ethnic identification is directly associated with the same decrease in national identity (Figure 1). A bidimensional conception of identity, in contrast, reflects that ethnic and national identification can be independent of each other (Figure 2).

If ethnic and national identification are incompatible, all observations will cluster on the dashed diagonal in Figure 2. However, if the hypothesis is correct, we will see significant spread around the diagonal and might also find observations in the first and third quadrants.

To estimate the relationship between ethnic identification and national identification, I use the following regression model.

$$ NationalID_i = \alpha + \beta_1 * EthnicID_i + \beta_2 * SocialTies_i +  \epsilon_i $$

$NationalID$ is the averaged z-score of two measures of national identification (see the Appendix for question wording), $EthnicID$ the averaged z-score of two measures of ethnic identification, and $\epsilon$ the error term. I also introduce two covariates. $SocialTies$ is the Z-score of the number of social ties a student has. I control for the number of social ties as students who interact more with others might feel more connected to both their ethnic group and their nationality.

Additionally, I use a second regression model with interaction term to examine whether the relationship between ethnic identification and national identification changes across different levels of perceived discrimination.

$$ NationalID_i = \alpha + \beta_1 * EthnicID_i + \beta_2 * Discrimination_i + \beta_3 * (EthnicID_i * Discrimination_i) + \epsilon_i $$

$Discrimination$ measures perceived discrimination and can take the values 'never', 'frequently', and 'always'. Again, I use z-scores in the regression. The assumption underlying this model is that perceived discrimination might make it harder to identify with both ethnicity and nationality. If a student feels like their ethnic group is discriminated against by other ethnic groups, they might also feel like the two forms of identification are incompatible and they are forced to choose between one and the other. Similar patterns have been found among Latino college students in the US [@fuller2013national]. If this assumptions is correct, we would expect a more negative relationship between ethnic identification and national identification at higher levels of perceived discrimination.

The graph below depicts ethnic and national identification among the students.

     ylab = 'National Identification',
     pch = 16,
     col = 'grey',
     abline(lm(national_index ~ ethnic_index, data = dat_z)))
```

There are observations in all four quadrants, and there seems to be no significant relationship between the two variables. The regression outputs confirm these findings:

## estimate models

models <- list()

models[['Interaction']] <- lm(national_index ~ ethnic_index * discrimination, data = dat_z)

```

There is no significant negative correlation between national and ethnic identification. In contrast, the coefficient for $EthnicID$ is positive, even though not significant. Furthermore, the coefficient for $SocialTies$ is positive but not significant either. This means that students with more social ties are not more likely to be dual identifiers. The coefficient for

### Conclusion

This implies that the framing of survey questions such as that mentioned in the introduction fail to adequately measure ethnic identification and national identification. They cannot account for people who identify with both their ethnicity and their nationality. Even though the unidimensional model may be accurate in some contexts, we still need the bidimensional model to demonstrate its accuracy by showing that there is a inverse correlation.

Overall, ... Possibility to achieve national identification even in ethnically diverse societies. National identification, in turn, can have a positive impact on state capacity and public good provision (due to willingness to pay taxes and higher levels of trust).
