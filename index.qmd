### Introduction

Many surveys use the following question to probe for respondents' ethnic and national identities: *Let us suppose that you had to choose between being a (Kenyan/Ghanaian/etc). and being a (respondent's ethnic group). Which of these two groups do you feel most strongly attached to?* [see, for example, @afrobarometer2020]. This question reflects the assumption that national and ethnic identification are incompatible. However, based on the analysis of survey data from Ethiopian students, I argue that this assumption is false and that some people identify with both their national and their ethnic identities. Furthermore, I find that many social ties do not make individuals more likely to be dual identifiers, but living in rural areas does.

### Literature Review

Studies that have been conducted in migrant communities consistently find that ethnic identification and national identification are compatible. @ryder2000 find that ethnic identification and national identification are independent and have distinctive correlations with external variables among immigrants in the US. A study of adolescent immigrants from 13 countries confirms their findings. The relationship between ethnic and national identification varies widely both across countries and across individuals -- reaching from negative to no relationship to positive [@berry2006].

There seems to be little evidence on the social identities of non-migrant communities in multi-ethnic countries. However, @davis1999 reports two different forms of identification among Basque people. One entails attachment to a Basque nation, the other is 'apolitical' in that it dissociates the nationalist movement from its perception of being Basque. It seems like dual identification may be possible among individuals who hold an apolitical form of ethnic identification.

### Data

I am using a representative survey of 825 students of Addis Ababa University. The survey consists of two waves, conducted in May-June and October-November of 2022. The data was collected by DevLab researchers from the University of Pennsylvania.

### Research Design

I hypothesize that ethnic and national identification are compatible. Hence, when measuring the two independently, there should be no negative relationship between them.

*Hypothesis: There is no significant negative correlation between ethnic and national identification.*

The above survey question reflects a unidimensional conception of identity. An increase in ethnic identification is directly associated with the same decrease in national identity (Figure 1). A bidimensional conception of identity, in contrast, reflects that ethnic and national identification can be independent of each other (Figure 2).

If ethnic and national identification are incompatible, all observations will cluster on the dashed diagonal in Figure 2. However, if the hypothesis is correct, we will see significant spread around the diagonal and might also find observations in the first and third quadrants

To estimate the relationship between ethnic identification and national identification, I use the following regression model.

$$ NationalID_i =\beta_1 * EthnicID_i + \beta_2 * Contacts_i + \beta_3 * Urban_i + \epsilon_i $$

$EthnicID$ is the averaged z-score of two measures of ethnic identification (see the Appendix for question wording), $NationalID$ the averaged z-score of two measures of national identification, and $\epsilon$ the error term. I use two control variables to account for potential confounding factors. Z-score of the number of contacts, urban binary indicator. ... This might also spark some ideas about how to foster dual-identification in fractured societies.

Additionally, I use a second regression model with interaction term to examine whether the relationship between ethnic identification and national identification changes across different levels of perceived discrimination.

$$ NationalID_i =\beta_1 * EthnicID_i + \beta_2 * Discrimination_i + \beta_3 * (EthnicID_i * Discrimination_i) + \epsilon_i $$

$Discrimination$ measures perceived discrimination and can take the values 'never', 'frequently', and 'always'. I use z-scores in the regression model.

### Conclusion

This also implies that the framing of survey questions such as that mentioned in the introduction fail to adequately measure ethnic identification and national identification. They cannot account for people who identify with both their ethnicity and their nationality. Hence, ...
